# Java Employee Database System using JPA
This project is a Java-based employee database system that utilizes Java Persistence API (JPA) for interacting with a relational database. The system allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, and provides a simple and convenient way to manage employee data.

## Features
- CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee records in the database.
- Search functionality: Search employees by various criteria such as employee ID, name, department, and more.
- Error handling: Proper error handling and exception management for graceful error recovery.
- Data validation: Validate employee data before persisting it to the database to ensure data integrity.
- Logging: Logging of important events and errors for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.
- Configurable: Ability to configure database connection settings, logging settings, and other application properties.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your local machine.
- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA for coding and debugging.
- Basic knowledge of Java programming and relational databases.

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up and run the employee database system:

- Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
- Import the project into your IDE as a Maven project. Make sure all dependencies listed in the pom.xml file are resolved.
- Configure the database connection settings in the application.properties file. Update the URL, username, and password according to your database setup.
- Run the application using the main method in the Application class. This will start the application and initialize the database with sample data.
- Access the employee database system through the provided endpoints, such as /employees for retrieving all employees, /employees/{id} for retrieving an employee by ID, and so on. Use a REST client or a web browser to test the API endpoints.
- Perform CRUD operations on employee records, search for employees, and manage employee data using the exposed API endpoints.

## Usage
The employee database system provides RESTful API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on employee records. The available endpoints include:

- `GET /employees`: Retrieve a list of all employees.
- `GET /employees/{id}`: Retrieve an employee by ID.
- `POST /employees`: Create a new employee record.
- `PUT /employees/{id}`: Update an existing employee record by ID.
- `DELETE /employees/{id}`: Delete an employee record by ID.
- `GET /employees/search`: Search for employees by various criteria.
REST client or any other tool of choice can be used to make HTTP requests to these endpoints and interact with the employee database system.
